# latest-greatest-r
A place to try out new packages and new ways of doing things.

## Background
I started learning R as a too-cheap-to-pay-for-Stata grad student in September 2008.

It was tough back then with no tidyverse, coursework tailored for Stata (including commands to type in!) and support that consisted of mailing lists telling amateurs like me we were worthless and should read the manual.

A couple of years ago, I converted much of my data wrangling workflow to the tidyverse, while working for [Peter Ellis](http://ellisp.github.io/). It was revolutionary and radically simplified getting the job done in R.

Since then I have kept tabs on all the fantastic additions to the tidyverse, and other great leaps forward in R, but have not had time to dive in and actually *change* my old habits.

## Objective
Practice the latest and greatest R packages on real data, so I remember how to use them!
